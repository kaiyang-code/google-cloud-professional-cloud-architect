# Notes

## Resource Manager

- **super admin:** the user that you used to sign up for Google Cloud
  - the user has the permission to do absolutely anything
  - when creating our first google user account, we are creating our organization, and the email used is the super admin

## Identity and Access Management

- **custom roles:** we need to remember to keep the custom role updated
  - for example, when a released service gets new features, the predefined role for the service is updated with the required permissions to use the new feature. However, we need to mannually add permissions to the custom role in order to use the service
- **service account impersonation:** refers to the ability of a service account to act on behalf of another user or service account, effectively assuming their identity and permissions for performing authorized actions
- **Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS):** automatically provisions users and groups from Active Directory to Cloud Identity or Google workspaces and implements a synchronization process that can be run on Google Cloud or in your on-premises environment
- **Active Directory:** a directory service developed by Microsoft and is a cornerstone in most corporate on-premises environments. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows environment
